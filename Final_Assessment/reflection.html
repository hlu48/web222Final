            <h3>Explain the concept of Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
                Responsive design means the website can automatically adjust its windows size on different devices, e.g. Phone, PC, TV.
                 If user is using a smartphone, the website should be able to adjust its resolution, screen size and orientation on its own, 
                 so user would not need to manually zoom in or scroll horizontally. Developers should always implement responsive design approach
                  and test on various of systems to improve user experiences and make management easier.

            <h3>Responsive Design & Web Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                Responsive design approach can be applied on various web technologies. Responsive design is not just about changing screen resolution or orientation, it consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. 
The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points. Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.
Responsive design greatly improves web technologies performance, and reduces cost of maintenance for web technologies. <br><br>

            <h3>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>
            <p>
                I learned that I can use  meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
                I can use viewport to adjust screen resolution for different smart devices, so browser can control page dimension and scaling. When creating website, developers need to take numerous factors into consideration, because users may visit website on different devices. It is important to utilize responsive design so users can enjoy browsing my website. .

            <h3>My Learning Experience</h3>
            <p>
                My learning experience is fantastic. I did not know anything about building website before taking this class, and I believe is a very good intro course for beginner. It is a great experience for me to learn Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
Personally I had a lot of fun working through the assignment. I had great sense of accomplishment to build a website from scratch in Assignment 5. I enjoyed the process of trying different CSS styles options and test it on my html to make my website look nice.
I look forward to take more web class in my future studies.
